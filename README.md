### ABSTRACT
Sign Language is the visual means of communication among the people with hearing 
and speaking impairments. In our project, Nepali Sign Language Recognition and 
Translation in Text and Speech using Open CV and CNN, we use Laptop’s webcam to 
capture and stream hand gestures and provide it as an input to the machine learning 
model, which uses Convolutional Neural Network to recognize Nepali Sign Language gestures. 
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Tensorflow was created. CNN is a type 
of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is widely used for image or object 
recognition and classification. For each Nepali Sign Language gestures, 2100 images 
were captured and stored in grayscale format and further preprocessing of the dataset 
was done. Then the machine learning model in Tensorflow was trained with the 
collected dataset. After training, the model was tested with the unseen data to get an 
accurate measure of how the model performs. Then parameter tuning of the model was 
done to see if its accuracy and to see if it can be improved in any way. Finally, Nepali 
Sign Language was predicted and the required output was extracted to the UI that 
displayed the text and also converted it into speech using text to speech conversion 
library.
